# Verifiable delay function implementations
I implement the VDF protocols from Wesolowski [1] and Pietrzak [2] in C/C++, using both OpenSSL and GNU MP for handling large integers.
I employ OpenSSL for its cryptographic features and GNU MP for its more user-friendly RNG.

The random oracle that hashes into a large set of prime numbers -- needed in the Wesolowski protocol -- is implemented using acceptance-rejection sampling.
